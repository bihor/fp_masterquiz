TYPO3 extension to create a quiz, poll or test. The participant result will be saved in the DB too and can be deleted automatically via Scheduler.

The results can be displayed as a chart too. An evaluation is possible too.

Features: a quiz, poll or test can be played by submitting a form or by submitting an AJAX-request.
