# fp_masterquiz

version 2.0.0

TYPO3 extension to create a quiz, poll or test. The participant result will be saved in the DB too and can be deleted automatically via Scheduler.

The results can be displayed as a chart too. An evaluation is possible too.

Features: a quiz, poll or test can be played by submitting a form or by submitting an AJAX-request.

7 question types/modes available: checkbox, radio-box, select-box, yes/no, text-field, textarea, star-rating.

This extension is not backward compatible to myquizpoll, but there is a simple import-task for myquizpoll-questions.
