# fp_masterquiz

version 1.3.4

TYPO3 extension to create a quiz, poll or test. The participant result will be saved in the DB too and can be deleted automatically via Scheduler.

This extension is not backward compatible to myquizpoll, but there is a simple import-task for myquizpoll-questions.

Features: a quiz, poll or test can be played by submitting a form or by submitting an AJAX-request.

You find the documentation at typo3.org: https://docs.typo3.org/p/fixpunkt/fp-masterquiz/master/en-us/

Last feature: question mode 4 implemented.
