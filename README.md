# fp_masterquiz

version 1.0.4

TYPO3 extension to create a quiz, poll or test. The participant result will be saved in the DB too and can be deleted automatically via Scheduler.

Features: a quiz, poll or test can be played by submitting a form or by submitting an AJAX-request.

You find the documentation at typo3.org: https://docs.typo3.org/p/fixpunkt/fp-masterquiz/master/en-us/

Last feature: email to user/admin (step 2).
